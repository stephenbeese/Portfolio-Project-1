        <h2>Competitive Scoring History</h2>
        <p>
            In the 1990 Nintendo World Championship competition, Tetris was the game to beat. The winner, Thor Aackerlund, is still seen by many as the best to have ever played.
       </p>
       <p>
            Today’s Classic Tetris tournaments are played on that same version of Nintendo Tetris, using original NES game systems, controllers, and Tetris cartridges.
       </p>
       <p>
            In 2009, a player named Harry Hong became the first to achieve the highest possible score of 999,999 points. From the beginning, competitive players of classic Tetris tried to push the game past what its developers imagined possible.
       </p>
       <p> 
            Once the score was pushed past 999,999, the game would no longer show an accurate score. Because playing in level 29 and beyond was out of the question, players aimed to break 1 million before the game would inevitably beat them. This meant maintaining “maxout pace” where players would complete enough “Tetrises” before the kill screen.
        </p>
       <p>
            When the Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC) debuted in 2010, the kill screen at level 29 was the game’s final, unbeatable boss. Players pushed to get the highest score possible before level 29, at which point the game’s pieces started falling at double speed. It seemed humanly impossible to keep up with the falling shapes, which would pile up on players’ screens and spell death for their game.
       </p>
       <p>
            The scoring system for NES is as follows:
        </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>level</th>
                    <th>points for 1 line</th>
                    <th>points for 2 lines</th>
                    <th>points for 3 lines</th>
                    <th>points for 4 lines</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>40</td>
                    <td>100</td>
                    <td>300</td>
                    <td>1200</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>80</td>
                    <td>200</td>
                    <td>600</td>
                    <td>2400</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>120</td>
                    <td>300</td>
                    <td>900</td>
                    <td>3600</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>...</td>
                    <td>...</td>
                    <td>...</td>
                    <td>...</td>
                    <td>...</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>400</td>
                    <td>1000</td>
                    <td>3000</td>
                    <td>12000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>n</td>
                    <td>40*(n+1)</td>
                    <td>100*(n+1)</td>
                    <td>300*(n+1)</td>
                    <td>1200*(n+1)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Tetris usually has a maximum score of 999,999. 
                However, with rom hacks you are able to allow the score to counter to to exceed past this usually capped score.
                They do this by assigning numbers past 1,000,000 to a letter. For example, 1,000,000 would be represented as A00000 and 1,100,000 would be B00000.
