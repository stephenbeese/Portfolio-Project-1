<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
    Tetris is one of the few games that achieves ultimate popularity. It is remarkably simple, yet remarkably difficult. It's been ported to every computer and game console known to man, and has sold millions of cartridges, tapes, and disks across the land.
</p>
<p>
    Besides that, it also led to one of the most interesting legal battles in the history of video games, leading to the famed Tengen version of Tetris and to the downfall of a few companies.
</p>
<p>
    While Tetris was created in 1984 creator Alexey Pajitnov hardly received any money until 1996. At the time Alexey was working as an Artificial intelligence researcher. Working for the society Academy of Sciences (one of the few Soviet organisations that had contact to the outside world). His job was to test capabilities of hardware sent to the academy, which he did by writing simple programmes for them. One of which being Tetris
</p>
<p>
    Tetris was originally programmed for use on the Russian electronica 60. Letters were used to form the shapes as the computer didn’t feature conventional graphics. Alexey and fellow developers planned to release and Tetris amongst other games all together in one system they called a Computer Funfair. However, due to the laws in the Soviet Union, attempting to make private sales of a product was a dangerous endeavor. Because they could not sell them they decided to give them away for free but, the only game which garnered much interest was Tetris. Because Pajitnov was working for the government and was using their equipment when he created Tetris, they retained the rights to the game in the beginning with no royalties being paid to Pajitnov.

<h2>Computer Rights</h2>
<p>
    One year later, the PC version makes its way to Budapest, Hungary, where it is ported to the Apple II and Commodore 64 by Hungarian programmers. These versions catch the eye of Robert Stein, president of the British software house Andromeda. He plans to get the rights to the PC version from Pajitnov directly, and to get the other versions from the Hungarian programmers. Even before Stein gets in touch with Pajitnov or the Academy, he sells all the rights to Tetris (except for arcade and handheld versions) to Mirrorsoft UK and its USA affiliate, Spectrum Holobyte, owned by Robert Maxwell's Pergamon Foundation.
</p>
<p>
    Later that year, Stein wires a contract for the rights to Tetris to the Academy. Although Pajitnov would later say that he did not mean to give a firm go-ahead to the deal, Stein goes ahead and flies to Moscow to sign the contract. He returns empty-handed; the Russians made up for their lack of knowledge of the video game world with obstinance. Stein makes a plan to essentially steal Tetris, to claim it was invented by the Hungarian programmers.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, the IBM PC version of Tetris is released by Spectrum Holobyte and Mirrorsoft, causing an instant sensation not only as an obscenely addictive game, but also as "the first game from behind the iron curtain". Stein still does not legally own any rights to Tetris.
</p>
<p>
    In June of 1987, Stein presses for and finally gets a license giving him the rights to make Tetris for the IBM PC and compatibles "and any other computer system". Now he owns the copyrights to Tetris, but he still doesn't have a contract with the Russians.
</p>
<p>
    Tetris is then  released for all home computers. It gets glowing reviews and sells quickly in computer stores. Stein's plan to "steal" the rights to Tetris is foiled when the CBS Evening News interviews Pajitnov as the inventor of the game. A new company, ELORG (Electronorgtechinca), takes over the negotiations with Stein. ELORG's director, Alexander Alexinko, realizes that Stein is giving out rights he doesn't have and threatens to cut off any deal. Stein, in turn, threatens to start an international situation.
</p>
<p>
    After months of bickering, Stein signs a contract with ELORG to make Tetris for computers. The contract expressly forbids rights to arcade and handheld versions, and any other mediums.
