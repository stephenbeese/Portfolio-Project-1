<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
    Tetris is one of the few games that achieves ultimate popularity. It is remarkably simple, yet remarkably difficult. It's been ported to every computer and game console known to man, and has sold millions of cartridges, tapes, and disks across the land.
</p>
<p>
    Besides that, it also led to one of the most interesting legal battles in the history of video games, leading to the famed Tengen version of Tetris and to the downfall of a few companies.
</p>
<p>
    While Tetris was created in 1984 creator Alexey Pajitnov hardly received any money until 1996. At the time Alexey was working as an Artificial intelligence researcher. Working for the society Academy of Sciences (one of the few Soviet organisations that had contact to the outside world). His job was to test capabilities of hardware sent to the academy, which he did by writing simple programmes for them. One of which being Tetris
</p>
<p>
    Tetris was originally programmed for use on the Russian electronica 60. Letters were used to form the shapes as the computer didn’t feature conventional graphics. Alexey and fellow developers planned to release and Tetris amongst other games all together in one system they called a Computer Funfair. However, due to the laws in the Soviet Union, attempting to make private sales of a product was a dangerous endeavor. Because they could not sell them they decided to give them away for free but, the only game which garnered much interest was Tetris. Because Pajitnov was working for the government and was using their equipment when he created Tetris, they retained the rights to the game in the beginning with no royalties being paid to Pajitnov.
